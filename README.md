# MD5-Implementation
This is by no means relevant for personal or industrial use, as it is severely compromised. Collisions can be detected very fast and easily. This was just a coding excercise, nothing much.

# Usage
Compile using gcc, using the command
gcc MD5_main.c -o MD5 -lm

Then run the executable, supplying the original message in the arguments
./MD5 "put your message here"
